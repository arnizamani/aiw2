# Alice In Wonderland, version 2.0 (AIW2)

*Authors:* Abdul Rahim Nizamani and Claes Stranneg√•rd

*Updated:* August 2016

This version extends the original AIW with analogical reasoning, and was presented in the Ninth AGI Conference 2016 (http://agi-conf.org/2016/).

The source has been compiled and tested on Ubuntu and Windows, but has complex dependencies. It requires cabal sandbox to properly install correct versions of the required libraries.
